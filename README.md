# Bunny Stream log parser

This PHP script is designed to analyze log files and count the hits on video files, served from Bunny Stream by Bunny CDN. It filters out real user requests and bot traffic. We need this since we don't use Bunny CDN's own player and don't get viewership data from them.

[Very WIP]
